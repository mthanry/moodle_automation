## Module Learning Objectives
* Understand and employ fundamental concepts and principles of programming such as variables, Boolean expressions, control flow structures, methods, arrays, etc.
* Demonstrate a structured approach to algorithmic design and problem solving and exhibit professional development best practices in designing and developing robust, maintainable software
* Illustrate and relate object-oriented concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) and employ them to solve practical, real-world problems
* Differentiate, select and utilise suitable application programming interfaces in the construction of software
* Discriminate between elements of object-oriented programming (abstract and nested classes, interfaces, access modifiers, etc.) and employ them appropriately in programme construction

## Code storage, editor/IDE setup
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**
	* Please register and let's create a first empty repository
- **[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)**
	* You can start any GitHub repository by appending `https://gitpod.io#` to the repo URL

## Python Files and REPL

There are two different modes to run Python:

* **Files**
	* Python files use the .py extension on the file.
	* Python files are read top down and execute **line-by-line**
	* Unlike *compiled languages*, Python (since it is *interpreted*) does not check **logical errors** before running your code.
	* This means any bugs that are written will only be caught by getting to that point in the running file.

* **REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)**
	* Python has an advantage over other languages in that you can run Python code without having it in a file.
	* You can use a REPL environment to run pieces of Python code on the fly, with immediate feedback and without having to create & run a file.

---

## REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop)

* On Windows, Mac and Linux you can run ```Python``` and should get a prompt like this:

```bash
Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 21:26:53) [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

* From here you can start typing Python code in, and it will run line by line as you type it.

## Python basic syntax: Comments

* In Python you can add comments (text that doesn't do anything)
* This is incredibly useful for leaving yourself and others notes about how code works, what code does, or to 'comment out' code that you just don't want to run
* Throughout the course most of the Python files will contain comments that will help you to understand what is happening in the code.
* Also, I will leave sections of challenges and exercises 'commented out' to allow you to work on them in order.

>  "Commenting your code is like cleaning your bathroom ‚Äì you never want to do it, but it really does create a more pleasant experience for you and your guests"    - Ryan Campbell

## Comments

There are two ways of doing comments:

1. Single line comments; comments that only span a single line are denoted with a # in front of them:

   ```Python
    # This is a single line comment
   ```

2. Multiline comments; comments that span multiple lines are denoted with three sets of double quotes:

    ```Python
    """
    This
    comment
    spans
    many
    lines
    """
    ```

* As you are going through it is always a good idea to put comments in your code so that other people (and you in 3 months) will know what's happening.

* Believe me this **will** make a difference

## Functions

* Functions in Python are commands you can use to do specific actions.
* Functions can also be given data (called arguments), and return data.

* The basic syntax looks like this

```Python
function-name(arguments)
```

---

## Functions

* You can tell that something is a function if it has parenthesis "()" after the function name.

* For example, the `print()` function in Python takes some text (a *string* [i'll explain what that is in the next lecture] as an argument) and prints it to the terminal.

```Python
print("Hello World!")
```

## Running Python code

To run your code (after you've written it) use: ```python (filename).py```
