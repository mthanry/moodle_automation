# Variables and Data Types

* When you are writing code you will often need to take data and use it/manipulate it in different ways to give a meaningful output.
* **Variables** and **Data Types** are key to understanding python (and any programming language).


---
## Variables

* If you remember from algebra ‚Äì variables are just some characters that were used to represent numbers.
* For example ```x = 5``` and then you could use it to say ```5 + x = 10```.

* Variables in Python work much the same way, except you can **store data** (sometimes this is referred to as **alias**) of different **types** (text, numbers, decimals etc.)

---
### Creating and updating variables

* The basic syntax for creating variables looks like this:

```python
variable_name = (some data)
```

* You put the *variable name* **on the left** (what you type in when you want to get the data)
* The *data* to store/alias **on the right** with a **single** '=' in between.

* If you wanted to create a name variable and store someone's name to print out later you could do this:

```python
name = "Kieran" # Created a variable called name
print(name) # Prints: Kieran
```

---

### Creating and updating variables
* You can also go in and update a value later on by assigning it some new data:

```python
name = "Kieran" # Create/instantiate name variable
print(name) # Prints: Kieran

name = "Bob" # Reassign name variable to 'Bob'
print(name) # Prints: Bob
```

---
### Variable names

* Naming variables can be hard sometimes, here are the general rules on what you can and cannot do with them.

* <u>**Can include:**</u>
	* All upper and lowercase letters
	* Underscores
	* Numbers (But not as the first character): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 

* <u>**Cannot include:**</u>
	* Dots (Possible but means something different in python): .
	* Reserved Characters (Characters that already do something in python): + | & * $ # @ ( ) ? < > = ' " \ / ^ ! ~ _
	* The first character as a number

---
### Variable names
<u>**MAKE VARIABLE NAMES USEFUL:**</u>
* Constantly reading `x`, `j`, `i`, `k` and other single letter variables, they all start to meld together.
* You can easily be confused because they give you no indication of what the variable actually represents (usually). 

---
#### Variable name guidelines

* Here are some guidelines to help create better variable names:

* Use the **4 W's** (Who, What, When, Where)

	* **Who:** If your variable represents someone or something then use their name  i.e.

        ```python
        p = "Lincoln" # Bad, what does p even mean in this context?
        
        president = "Lincoln" # Now you know what I am talking about without seeing the code
        ```

	* **What:** what the variable is in this context.

        ```python
        dx = 5 # If you know the notation this might make sense but what if someone doesn't
        
        delta_x = 5 # You know exactly what the variable represents
        ```

---

#### Variable name guidelines

* Use the **4 W's** (Who, What, When, Where)

	* **When:** this may be less apparent right now but when we look at loops later this naming convention can be useful.

        ```python
        d = "17-10-2019" # We can infer it's a date, but what date is it?
        
        current_date = "17-10-2019" # Now we know it represents the current date
        ```

	* **Where:** Only useful in specific use cases but still better than nothing.

        ```python
        l = (51.0447, 114.0719) # ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Who knows what this variable represents
        
        user_coordinates = (51.0447, 114.0719) # Ahh it's user coordinates
        ```
---

#### Variable name guidelines

* This can sometimes be difficult but if you do it then others looking at your code will hate you much less when your code breaks.

## Data Types

<div style="float:left;width:50%;">

* Python can store many different ***data types***, we have already seen a few in our examples.
* As you saw we can store basic (primitive) ***data types***, such as:
	* text ‚Äì **string(s)** or **str**
	* whole numbers ‚Äì **integers** or **ints**
	* decimals ‚Äì **float(s)**
	* or ***collections*** of data types
* Later on we will learn how to create your own data types.

</div>

## Data Types
* If you are ever unsure you can actually see the 'type' of a variable by using the type() function. For example:

```python
variable_1 = 5 # An integer or int
variable_2 = "hello" # A string or str

print(type(variable_1)) # Prints <class 'int'>
print(type(variable_2)) # Prints <class 'str'>
```

---
### Primitive Data types
* **Integer (or int)**
	* Any positive or negative **whole number**:

        ```python
        number_1 = 1 # Positive int
	
        number_2 = -2 # Negative int
        
        number_3 = 1236655686547564756474657457 # Large positive int
        
        number_4 = -432587965423943857612347861 # Large negative int
        ```

* **Float**
	* Any positive or negative **decimal number**

        ```python
        number_1 = 1.5 # Positive float
        
        number_2 = -2.345 # Negative float
        
        number_3 = 12366556.7893 # Large positive float
        
        number_4 = -432587965423.3457 # Large negative float
        ```

---

### Primitive Data types
* **String**
	* Text; Note that this can include numbers 

        ```python
        variable_1 = "This is a string" # Anything inside the "" is part of the string
        
        variable_2 = 'This is a string' # You can also use '' to create strings
        ```

* **Boolean**
    * Used to indicate **True or False**; Note that True and False also correspond to 1 and 0 respectively

        ```python
	# Booleans are created by just writing true or false
	# NOTE: Capitalise the first letters!
	
       variable_1 = True # True or 1

       variable_2 = False # False or 0
       ```
---
### Collections

* **Collections** are data types that allow you to store multiple variables (referred to as elements) inside of them.
* This is convenient in many cases to store data that is logically grouped together like a shopping list, or names of people in a group/class.
* I will mention **3 of the most common collections** but there are actually **[many]( https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html)** more available in python to cover a wide variety of use cases.

---
### Collections: Lists
* **Lists**
	* Allow you to **store** and **change** values (Sometimes called mutating values) that are added to it.
	* Here is an example of setting up various types of lists
    
        ```python
        variable_1 = []              # An empty list
        
        variable_2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]    # A list of ints
        
        variable_3 = [2, "two", 2.1] # A list of mixed data types
        
        # You can use the list.append() method to add elements to an existing list
        variable_2.append(10) # variable_2 is now: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
        ```

	* You can access values stored in a list by using their ***index***.
	* Indices are counted **from zero up** as you add elements to the list.
---
### Collections: Lists
* **Lists**

	* Take for example the following list:
    
        ```python
        variable_4 = [4, 9, 2, 7] # This is the list used in the next image
        ```

	<img src="../Images/list-indices.png" alt="list-indeces" style="zoom:40%;" />
    
    * So to access the *elements* you would use the following format:
    
        ```python
        print(variable_4[0]) # Prints: 4
        
        print(variable_4[1]) # Prints: 9
        
        print(variable_4[2]) # Prints: 2
        
        print(variable_4[3]) # Prints: 7
        ```
---
### Collections: Tupes
* **Tuples**
	* Tuples are similar to lists, the biggest difference being that they are *immutable*, meaning the *elements* cannot be updated after they have been added.
	* Also *Elements* **cannot** be added to tuples after they have been created. Tuples have a similar syntax to list for creating them, and the exact same syntax for accessing elements:

        ```python
        variable_1 = ()              # An empty tuple
        variable_2 = (2, 4, 6, 8)    # A tuple of ints
        variable_3 = (2, "two", 2.1) # A tuple of mixed data types
        variable_4 = (4, 9, 2, 7)    # This is the same as the list used in the previous example
        
        # Accessing and printing values
        print(variable_4[0]) # Prints: 4
        print(variable_4[1]) # Prints: 9
        print(variable_4[2]) # Prints: 2
        print(variable_4[3]) # Prints: 7
        ```

---
### Collections: Dictionaries

	
* **Dictionaries**
	* Dictionaries are what's called a key-value store data structure.
	* Dictionaries are also *mutable* like lists, which means you can add and update *elements* as you please.
	* What this means is that instead of using indices that go up every time something is added, they use **key's** that correspond to **values** to access & insert data

---

### Collections: Dictionaries

<img src="../Images/key-value.png" alt="key-value" style="zoom:40%;" />

```python
variable_1 = {} # Empty dictionary

variable_2 = {"name": "John Doe"} # Assigning the key 'name' to the value 'John Doe'

# Dictionaries can contain values of different types, but keys must be strings
variable_3 = {"name":"John Doe", age: 21, "net worth": 5213.4}

# To access a value, use the key as you would an index
print(variable_3["name"]) # Prints: John Doe

# Adding new key-value pairs to a dictionary uses the same syntax
variable_2["age"] = 21 # variable_2 is now: {"name":"John Doe", age: 21}
```

---
#### Mutability

* Mutability, or the ability to mutate/change an element once it has been added to a collection is an important distinction that can cause many common errors. 
* Lists are a *mutable* data structure, meaning their *elements* can be updated while they are part of the list.
* This means that they should **only** be used in cases where this makes sense, for example a list of configuration information.
* Tuples on the other hand are immutable, meaning once an *element* is in a tuple it will stay as it is, this is useful for places where data <u>shouldn't</u> be changing.
	* For example if you wanted to store a list of Dates of birth, you wouldn't want someone accidentally updating them if they thought it was a list of dates for something else and so a tuple would likely be more appropriate.

---
### Type Casting

* In python you can convert data between data types.
* Python is what's called a **strongly typed** language, what this means is that python won't do any converting unless you **explicitly** ask it to. For example 

```python
variable_1 = "4" # Currently is the string '4'

2 + variable_1 # Would throw an error

print(2 + int(variable_1)) # Would convert the string 4 to an int and then print 6
```
